# Employee-Attrition-Prediction
## In this project, I will analyze the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and extract valuable insights from the features. Furthermore, I will attempt to build a predictive model that can help us determine whether employees are likely to leave the company or stay based on various independent features.

This dataset contains information about employees in a company, including their educational backgrounds, work history, demographics, and employment-related factors. It has provided valuable insights into the workforce.

## Features include:

1. Education: The educational qualifications(Level) of employees
2. Joining Year: The year each employee joined the company, indicating their length of service.
3. City: The location or city where each employee is based or works.
4. Payment Tier: Categorization of employees into different salary tiers.
5. Age: The age of each employee, providing demographic insights.
6. Gender: Gender identity of employees, promoting diversity analys
7. Ever Benched: Indicates if an employee has ever been temporarily without assigned work.
8. Experience in Current Domain: The number of years of experience employees have in their current field.
9. Leave or Not: Target variable, based on the independent variables predicting the Employee leave or not.
